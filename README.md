# Machine Learning, Statistics and Psychology

## Description:

This is a project that aims to implement machine learning and deep learning models, and statistical testing methods from scratch only using `NumPy` and `python`. First, I started to implement common machine learning algorithms such as Linear Models and Support Vector Machines to understand them better, get a better mathematical intuition about how they work and develop my python skills further. During this process, I realized it is really fun to deep dive into the algorithms, and I learned a lot about mathematics, implementation, and structures of these algorithms. So, I started implementing more and more. In the future I want to expand this to statistical models. Currently, there are more than 20 machine learning algorithms implemented, but no statistical models. But in the future whenever I have time I will try to add more and more. 

## What Algorithms are impelements:

- Linear Regression,
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression 
- ElasticNet Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Classifier
- Lasso Classifier
- ElasticNet Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor
- Linear Support Vector Machine
- Perceptron based on: F. Rosenblatt. The perceptron, a perceiving and recognizing automaton Project Para. Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, 1957.
- Adaline based on: B. Widrow et al. Adaptive ”Adaline” neuron using chemical ”memistors”. Number Technical Report 1553-2. Stanford Electron. Labs., Stanford, CA, October 1960.
- Random Forest Classifier
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- AdaBoost Regression: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.21.5683&rep=rep1&type=pdf
- Voting Classifier
- Voting Regressor
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)


### What are future plans:

In the future, I am planning to add deep learning methods such as Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. Furthermore, I want to add more statistical models and tests such as t-test, Anova, Linear Mixed Models, Bayesian Models, and many more. 

## How to use it:

You can test performance of each algorithms easily by using `testing.py` file with many popular datasets using sklearn data sets.
